Hi Jonathan,

As promised, here is the feedback from your test -

POSITIVES
+ it's in nodeJS 
+ has automated tests that pass 
+ has thought about domain design and extensibility 
+ has extended README

NEGATIVES

Major:

- ES6 use of classes is problematic (e.g. declaring everything inside a constructor) 
- use of OO-style is problematic (e.g. classes that do not encapsulate any state e.g. "Intersection") 
- introducing test-only code in production is questionable (it is to test a private function but that function does not even need to be private as it does not access any private state) 
- code readability is poor in a number of places e.g. in Intersection::changeOneTrafficLight() what is yellowOnly? no comments, too many conditional statements etc. 
- expected some more thought about error-handling at least at the level of comments or README

Minor:

- code commit comments are not informative 
- "use strict" is redundant in modern versions of node 
- missed a lot of semicolons 
- a few typos in the comments and documentation 
- expected better use of npm (like npm test) 
- does not specify version of nodeJS should be used
